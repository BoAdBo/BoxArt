A crew management system can store the training record and provide a great feed
back for the training crew. Our crew is training on a daily basis, one finds
that by comparing and contrast, would make a positive and huge impact on the
confidence and momentum of the training individuals as well as crew members.
Therefore developing a crew management system would greatly enhance the efficiency
in terms of designing training plans and logging.

\section{功能需求分析}
%making the blow text smaller perhaps?
\textbf{A basic crew management system would require the following N functionalities:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  {user management
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item{user adding\\
        include 3 kinds of member type: Crew Coach, Crew Leader, Crew member\\
        
        Crew Coach can announce the plans for this year: have access to
        modifying the calender: dates for group extra training program, dates for out
        field races, etc..\\
        
        Crew Leader can design and publish training plans(in the form of
        notice-board) and specify the training program for the day. Have access
        to team budgets, logging of team budgets.\\
        
        Crew members can update their status on the training program of the day.
        How many push-ups and squats(training programs of the day), how much time
        for the 10 laps running, etc..\\
        
        To be continued...
        }
      \item{user deletion\\
          the deletion of the mentioned crew member types. Cascade deletion(deleting
          team members would also delete their training records)
        }
      \item{password modification
          add password, update password. Involves registration.\\
        }
    \end{enumerate}
  }
\item {}
  
\end{enumerate}
